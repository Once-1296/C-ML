# C-ML (Machine Learning Framework in C)

C-ML is a machine learning framework written in C. It is designed to be simple, fast, and easy to use. It is also designed to be easily extensible, so that you can implement your own algorithms.

## Installation

To install C-ML, simply clone the repository and run `make` in the root directory. This will create a `bin` directory, which will contain the `main` executable.

1. Clone the repository: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jaywyawhare/C-ML.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev make cmake gcc build-essential 
    ```

3. Build the project:
    ```bash
    cd C-ML
    make
    ```

## Features

- *Modular*: C-ML is designed to be modular, so that you can easily implement your own algorithms.

- *Fast*: C-ML is written in C, which is a fast language. It also uses the GNU Scientific Library (GSL), which is a fast library for scientific computing.


## Future Work

- *Implement more algorithms*: C-ML currently only has a few algorithms implemented. I plan to implement more algorithms in the future.
