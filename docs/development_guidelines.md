# Development Guidelines

## Code Style
- Follow consistent indentation and naming conventions.
- Use meaningful variable names.
- Add comments to explain complex logic.

## Error Handling
- Check for null pointers and invalid inputs.
- Use `fprintf` to log errors and exit gracefully.

## Memory Management
- Allocate memory dynamically where necessary.
- Free allocated memory to prevent leaks.

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all functions.
- Use assertions to validate expected behavior.
