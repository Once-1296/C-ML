# Development Guidelines

## Code Style
- Follow consistent indentation and naming conventions.
- Use meaningful variable names.
- Add comments to explain complex logic.

## Error Handling
- Check for null pointers and invalid inputs.
- Use `LOG_ERROR` macro to log errors
- return a `CM_Error` status code if recoverable...
- or exit gracefully if not.

## Memory Management
- Allocate memory dynamically where necessary.
- Free allocated memory to prevent leaks.

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all functions.
- Use assertions to validate expected behavior.
